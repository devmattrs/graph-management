## Graph Task Management

### The Idea
The idea here was to have a graph based UI that would handle sprints in a highly visual way. This would help in driving work and visibility all the way up and down the organization. I never got to the point that it was scoped by user but that was the end result here. 

### Structure
This project is a mono repo that consists of 2 web apps (in the /apps folder). One of these is a landing page and the other is the application dashboard. Both are consuming styling and data fetching code from /packages. The reason for this was for a clear seperation of concerns. Admittedly the project was suppose to be a big ship for me but I got too  bogged down.
